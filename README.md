# Warehouse Inventory Management System

This is a simple application for inventory management system that includes
1. a product viewer which displays all product data
2. inventory management tool which can update  local and global quantities of a product based on location

This is a single page application built using React, which is served by Node/ExpressJS on the back end querying a MySQL DB

There's no responsive behaviour set for mobile, as this is primarily intended for use by warehouse staff, however this may be fixed in future iterations.
